This is readme file in master branch
added the line to create a merge conflict in master branch
Added statement to read me in new_branch for merge conflict

for merge conflict the change must be done on same line by different branches.
We can resolve them by editing the file between the >>>>>>> and ======= and ======= <<<<<<< . 
Remove those signs and keep the required merging statements .
If you want to have current branch changes then use statement between the <<<<<<< and =======
If you want to have new branch changes then use statement between the ======= and >>>>>>>.
